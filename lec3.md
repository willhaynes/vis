# Lecture 3 

__Tuesday Jan 27__

### Today

 - The faster we can get through all the readings, the faster we can get onto other things.
 - Some things get more pedantic. "Who cares what we call something." â€” just food for thought.
 - Consider what the potential range is and the __principles__ apply across all.
 - Making visible things more visible, a definition for art.
 - Is art visualization, and is visualization art?
 - [Klein Blue](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/IKB_191.jpg). Is it art? He successfully communicate an experience of "blueness."
 - There are a bunch of terms. Why do we need to categorize things into buckets?
 	- scientific vis vs information vis.
 	- visual analytics vs information vis.
 	- infographics vs information vis.
 	- data art vs ...
 - "pure academic tribalism."
 - A lot of vis is "which way do you look from."

### Tufte

 - Professor at Yale (stats, information design and interface design)
 - "pioneer" in the field of data visualization.
 - __url__: [http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte).
 - "tufteism."

> "every time you make a powerpoint, edward tufte kills a kitten."

 - Tufte doesn't tell us what visualization is, just what it does.
 - He is into minimalism. Two take aways:
 	- Where did it come from?
 	- We should not have that belief, take it at face value.
 - Tufte Rules:
 	1. Show your data, 
 	2. use graphics, 
 	3. avoide chartjunk, 
 	4. utilize data-ink, 
 	5. use labels, 
 	6. utilize micro/macro, 
 	7. seperate layers, 
 	8. use multiples, 
 	9. utilize colors _(correctly)_, 
 	10. understand narrative.
 - Represent numbers in a proportional way.
 - Show data variation, not design variation.
 - Tufte's crusade _What was he crusading against_?
 	- Computers got good enough that users [could create terrible things](http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/entertainment/07/06/13_tufte1.jpg), but not have the common sense not to.
 	- Data distortion.
 	- Unintended size coding.
 	- Maximize the data-ink ratio
 - Minimalism is not a reason not to use 3D.
 - One opposite to tufte is "bad," the other opposite is conciously trying to do something.

### Nigel Homes

 - First information designers to bring data visualization to a large, mainstream audience.
 - worked for time creating "explanation graphics."
 - Homes goal is visual explanations.

> For tufte, you might say the data speaks for itself. For Homes, you might say the goal is to motivate the reader.

### Takeaway:

 - Once again, understand your task.
