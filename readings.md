### Chapter 1: What is Vis, and why do it?

> "Visualization is suitable when there is a need to augment
human capabilities rather than replace people with computational
decision-making methods"

 - 1.2 "Why have humans in the loop?" 
 - Automated systems are designed to replace humans. Visual systems are to help humans make better educated decisions.

> Vis systems are appropriate for use when your goal
is to augment human capabilities.

 - 1.3 "Why have a computer in the loop?"
 - Computers are designed to compute, on lots of data.
 - 1.6 "Why show all the data in detail?"

> any depiction of data is
an abstraction where choices are made about which aspects to
emphasize.
