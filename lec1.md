### Data Visualization

General definitions: "The visual representation of data"

Mike's definition: "A _picture_ designed to help _someone_ do _something_."

 - Could be something in your head.
 - Could be physical (lego).
 - Some of the ways we use pictures to communicate can be applied to constructed visualizations.
 - How you implement something (the implementation medium) is seperate from what it's about.

Computer based visualization systems provide visualization representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks effectively.

__datasets__: is data necessary? could visualizations be conseptual? [Napkin sketches](https://www.google.com/search?q=ny+times+napkin+sketches&espv=2&biw=1207&bih=708&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=DkXBVMOKA5aBygS9qICICA&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg)

"Visualization" means something in the CS research community: people who help people make sense of data.

### This class: 

 - Principles, not steadfast rules.
 - Abstract, not domain specific (it's easy to get carried away by content)

> "Check your data at the door."

__Designed v. not-designed__: making concious choices, vs things happening by accident.

__Design v. implementation__: figuring out what something should be vs making it. If you're not able to design, it doesn't really matter how good you are at the implementation.
 - Design doesn't change. Good design is universal.
 - Implementations changes really fast.

### Users

 - __Readers__ (viewers): Most people. Hove to be good at this to be a good writer.
 - __Writers__:
 	- Vis creators: Have data to show.
 	- Toolsmiths: Create tools for creators.
 	- Researchers: Acedemic.
