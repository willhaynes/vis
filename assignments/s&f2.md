> A brief description of what is is, and what the visualization shows

[This is a visualization](http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/01/20/scaling-el-capitan-for-your-browser/) put together by the NY Times a few weeks ago of the route Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson took on their free-climb of The Dawn Wall.

A week later they published the same high resolution graphic, but without the 3D mesh. I found this interesting to look at because it shows how two very different things can be built from the same data. The 3D model shows the shear scale of the wall while the 2D massive image lets you traverse the wall with detail without getting a sense of the scale.

It's only made more interesting by [an accompanying article](http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/01/20/scaling-el-capitan-for-your-browser/) (published a week later) describing some of the technical challenges — and more interestingly — a description of the task they were trying to accomplish with this particular graphic.

> You explanation of why it needed to be a visualization.

I think this one struck me because I had been skimming over the headlines and articles about Caldwell and Jorgesons' climb because none were able to catch my interest for long enough to communicate the human feat.

This graphic did it immediately and pulled me into all of their supporting content about the expedition.
