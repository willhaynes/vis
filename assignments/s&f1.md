> What is this visualization?

FiveThirtyEight’s World Cup predictions

> What does it show?

Relative strengths of teams entering the 2014 world cup, as well as the organization of the tournament.

> Why are you interested in it?

I'm not much of a sports fan — much less a soccer fan. But I am interested in having an idea of what the media conversation around the event was about.

This visualization helped me this summer quickly get up to speed with relative strengths of teams, how the groups were organized and the relative strengths of each team.
