## Lecture 2 

__Thursday Jan 22__

### Intro

 - "I know something and I want to communicate it to you" is just one of the tasks of vis.
 	- __others:__
 		- Help you find something you don't know.
 		- Serve as an external aid to cognition.
 		- &c.
 	- __examples:__
 		- Long multiplication.
 - It's important to know your goals before starting.
 	- Process: __task__, data, design, implementation.


### Design/Re-design

__4 move__ framework.

 - Layout
 - Encoding
 - Data transformation
 - Interaction.

### Class strategy

__Why__? _simple examples, standard design, perception, focus on task, implementation_.

Outline:

 - What & why.
 - Abstraction: Tasks and Data.
 - Task Bravery: Thinking Differently.
 - Evaluation: How do we know if its good?.
 - Perception.
 - Encodings (the visual variables) & Layout.
 - Interaction and Multiple Views.
 - Graphic Design.

 - Graphs and Networks.
 - Multi-variate.
 - Too much stuff.
 - Experiments & Statistics.
 - Animation and Motion.
 - Scientific Visualization.
 - Showing 3D Well.
 - Thoughts on implementation.

### Critique

 1. Know the purpose of the work.
 2. Say something good.
 3. Be specific about problems.
 4. Don't dictate what to do.
 5. It's about the work, not the person.

Task is how we get away from just doing something gimmicky.

### Mike's projects.

 - You can get the same principles out of `art` as `visual cognitive science`.
 - Easy to solve an abstract problem and fail to solve a concrete problem.
